abstract: It is commonly believed that a norm of consensus-based election reform
  exists in New Zealand. However, this belief has yet to be tested with
  systematic study of changes to the democratic rules of the game. This article
  empirically analyzes the extent to which partisan and restrictive election
  rules have been proposed and enacted since passage of the Electoral Act 1956.
  Using a novel matrix of election lawmaking, a wealth of primary textual
  sources, and interviews with key actors, the data show clear evidence that
  election reforms are routinely partisan and have occasionally curtailed
  democratic participation. An analysis of election lawmaking by political party
  reveals that Labour is responsible for most partisan election reforms, whereas
  National has passed most demobilising enactments. These trends extend to
  proposed membersâ€™ bills and across multiple governments. The findings
  highlight the need for scholars to take seriously the importance of a broader
  array of election reforms beyond the electoral system, including voter and
  registration administration, franchise rules, ballot initiatives, electoral
  governance, and campaign finance. It also underscores the need for systematic
  study of election reforms in a wider variety of countries.
