I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, with concentrations in American politics, methods, racial and ethnic politics, and comparative politics. My dissertation examines emerging challenges to election administration in the U.S. such as increasing partisan polarization, the limits of accountability for local offices, a diversifying America, and heightened turnover in the profession. I combine large-scale original data on local election officials with administrative datasets on elections and employ modern empirical techniques for causal inference to study questions about partisanship, accountability, and representation. I also study the racliaization of anti-democratic attitudes, the politics of electoral reform, primary elections, and New Zealand politics.

I hold a Master of Arts degree in Political Science from the University of California, Los Angeles and a Master of Arts degree in Politics from the University of Otago, which I earned on a Fulbright Grant to New Zealand. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Amherst College with majors in Political Science and Music. My work has been published or is forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals such as *The American Political Science Review* and *The British Journal of Political Science*; in reports with the Bipartisan Policy Center and Transparency International; and in media outlets such as *The Washington Post* and *The Conversation*. My work has also received coverage from major news sites including *NBC*, *NPR*, and *The Guardian*.
