I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of California, Los Angeles, with concentrations in American politics, methods, racial and ethnic politics, and comparative politics. My research focuses on the link between local elections and representation, partisanship in U.S. election administration, and the politics of electoral reform. I also study democratic participation, criminal justice, and New Zealand politics.

I hold a Master of Arts degree in Politics from the University of Otago, which I earned on a Fulbright Grant to New Zealand. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Amherst College with majors in Political Science and Music. My work has been published in *Representation* and *Political Science* and has appeared in *The Washington Post*'s Monkey Cage and *The Conversation*.
